#The Artificial Intelligence Induced Schumpeterian Creative Destructive Event #in Medicine 

##Overview and Origin: 
*Ten years from now, physicians will remember 2023 as the beginning of a major shift in medicine. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will change medicine as monumentally as antibiotics, anesthesia, antisepsis, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Diagnostic physicians, such as general internal medicine physicians and family practitioners, will be affected the most. Physicians will do things with their hands, such as surgeons, will be affected less, but they will still see monumental changes.*
*In an open letter to the members of the American College of Surgeons (ACS), James Elsey, MD, FACS, Past Vice Chair if the Board of Regents of the ACS, recounted a conversation he had with a Harvard educated professor of IT who specializes in AI. She told him that AI will have dramatic transformative effects in medicine.(Ref 1) As Dr. Elsey said*
>”Big data a and AI will no doubt provide increasingly powerful tools to allow us to significantly innovate and improve our clinical care and future research . However, as we ineluctably become more and more reliant on these powerful technologies I believe we must guard ourselves against becoming impersonal interfaces between the patient and Data.”<

*In a study of physician and chatbot responses to random questions posted on Reddit’s r/AskDocs, evaluators preferred the chatbot responses over the physician responses. The chatbot responses were longer (211 versus 52 words), were more likely to contain high-quality knowledge (78.5% versus 22.1%), and more likely to contain high-quality empathy (45.1% versus 4.6%). (Ref 2) Some authors feel that AI will be implemented quickly and improve quality healthcare delivery. (Ref 3)*
*However, there are concerns – patient privacy, scrupulous use, unfair or deceptive practices, discrimination – just to name a few issues. (Ref 4) On October 30, 2023, President Joe Biden introduced an executive order on AI, which calls on the federal government to stimulate research in AI, but also regulate AI. (Ref 5) Ever the overachieving profession, the American Medical Association (AMA) published a statement on the use of “augmented intelligence” on November 14, 2023 – just 15 days later. (Ref 6). This white paper describes when and what to disclose, physician liability, and data privacy.* 
*Although there numerous AI startups that are focused on various aspects of medicine, such as Deep 6 AI (focuses on finding patients for medical studies), a frequent use is diagnosis and prognosis. Often this AI query is initiated by the patient.*
*For the past decade or so, physicians have utilized UpToDate, a diagnostic tool published by Wolters Kluwer, that is a leading clinical decision support (CDS) product. On October 3rd, 2023, Wolters Kluwer announced that they will be adding generative AI Labs for UpToDate. (Ref 7) The big fish in the market is about to squash all of the little fish.*

*Name of company: Wolters Kluwer (Ref 8)*
*When was it incorporated: Founded in 1836*
*Founders – 4 informational literature publishers: Wolters, Noordhoff, Samson, and Kluwer.*
*How did the idea for the company come about: Need for consolidated professional information.*
*Funding? Currently a profitable company trading in the US as an American Depository Receipt.*
	
##Business activities
*What is specific problem it is trying to solve? Specifically, UpToDate, provides contemporary medical information to physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs).*
*Who are the customers? According to the company, UpToDate is used by more than 2 million users at over 44,000 healthcare organizations, in over 190 countries. Medical professionals use UpToDate to view over 650 million topics per year.* 
*What does the company offer? Global provider of professional information in healthcare, taxes, risk management, and law.* 
* Which technologies are they using? The company uses Large Language Processing similar to ChatGPT.*

##Landscape
*What field is the company in? Medical information for diagnosis and prognosis*
*Major trends and innovations in this field: The medical field is reticent to embrace new technology. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are a relatively new concept. I remember Epic (one of the most popular EMR programs) being installed in the early 2000s; however, hospital systems are still moving from paper to EMRs. EMRs at different hospital systems still cannot “talk” to each other efficiently* 
*What are the other major companies in this field? DynaMed and MDCalc*

##Results
*How has this company impacted the field of medicine? UpToDate is commonly used by diagnostic physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs)* 
*What are the core metrics? For just health information, 9-month revenues increased 6%, clinical solutions increased 7%. They also obtained a New England Journal of Medicine digital distribution contract. (Ref 9)*

*Competitors in the information content field: According to Jotform, these are the other medical diagnostic tools:  VisualDx (just for dermatology issues), DynaMed, and MDCalc. (Ref 10)*
*Performance of competitors versus Wolters Kluwer? DynaMed and MDCalc have a limited library of clinical decision supports. Not all diseases are in their libraries. Neither of these companies are profitable. Wolters Kluwer is based in the Netherlands and is a public stock traded on the Euronext Stock Exchange (WKL). The American depositary receipts are traded over the counter (OTC: WTKWY). The ADR currently trades at $138.42 (12/3/21), up 131.6% over the last 5 years.*

##Recommendations
*What advice would I offer? Have the diagnostic information projected on specialized glasses.*
*How will it help the company? More physicians will use UpToDate if they can see the information without leaving the patient. Patients get upset when a physician leaves their room to “look up information”.* 
*What tech would this product utilize? Google glasses.*
*Why are these technologies appropriate for my idea? The physician can see the information without the patient realizing they are reading a differential diagnosis for their symptoms.*
